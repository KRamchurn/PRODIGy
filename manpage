Synopsis:

PRODIGy.py [-h] [-i FILE] [-c] [-o]

Description: 

This piece of software aims to digest amino acid sequences in a FASTA format, and provide an output of cleaved sequences. The enzymes which shall be used in order to digest these protein sequences are:

Trypsin, which cleaves at either Lysine (K), or Arginine (R), unless the subsequent amino acid is Proline (P). 

Endoproteinase Lys-C, which cleaves at Lysine (K), unless the following amino acid is Proline(P).

Endoproteinase Arg-C, which cleaves at Arginine (R), unless the following amino acid is Proline, (P). 

V8 Proteinase, which cleaves at Glutamic acid (E), unless the following amino acid is Proline, (P).

Output will take the form of: 

>I.claudius_0001 2+ 607 1190
SFIKTGSNAQQDE

Where: 
-	The first line is taken entirely from the first line of the input file, where:
o	I.claudius is the name of the organism 
o	0001 is the unique sequence number
o	2+ is the frame reading number 
o	607 is the length of the entire sequence number in amino acids 
o	1190 is the ORF start position in nucleotides  
-	SFIKTGSNAQQDE is the protein fragment cleaved when using V8 Proteinase.

Options: 

-i FILE, --input FILE
         Please enter the file (with extension) that you wish to parse
-o FILE, --output FILE
This shall provide an output for observation provided the given   input
-c {Trypsin,Endoproteinase_LysC,Endoproteinase_Arg,V8_Proteinase}, --choice {Trypsin,Endoproteinase_LysC,Endoproteinase_Arg,V8_Proteinase}
         Choose which enzyme to use out of Trypsin,
         Endoproteinase_LysC, Endoproteinase_Arg and
         V8_Proteinase
